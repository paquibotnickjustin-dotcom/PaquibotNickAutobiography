            <p>
                Hello! My name is Nick Justin B. Paquibot, and this is the story of my life...
                I am an aspiring IT/Geology student studying here in Lapu-Lapu City College.
                Now why is there a "/Geology" on that sentence? It's because aside from being
                an IT student, a piece of me is also interested in Geology, also known as the 
                study of rocks and minerals.
            </p> <br>

        <section class="section">
            <img src="Images/LLCC Picture.jfif" alt="LLCC Picture" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                I am currently 18 years old, born here in the City of East, aka Lapu-Lapu City.
                I consider myself as an adventurous type of student, but aside from that, I am
                also the type of student who is indecisive. What I noticed about me is that 
                apart from all my strengths, there are always weaknesses that are ready to hinder
                my strengths.
            </p> <br>

        <section class="section">
            <img src="Images/Studying Picture.jfif" alt="Studying Picture" class="section-image" />
            <p> 
                Now... why am I making this autobiography? As a student, it is our goal to caress
                and take care of our grades, not just for myself, but for my future. If I want to
                have a good future, I should start on improving and being the best me. School may
                sometimes be considered a hindrance on some of our personal stuff, but trust me,
                here is where we develop different sets of skills that we may not hone on our own,
                this place is where we prepare for the future.

            <p>
                Even though I'm already at the age of 18, playing games is still part of my life.
                I play different games like MLBB, Roblox, Minecraft, etc. I use gaming as a way
                to cope with stresses in personal life, education, everything about stress. I consider
                gaming as a way to cure stress and problems.

            <img src="Images/Gardening Picture.jfif" alt="Gardening Picture" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                One thing I love that might not be expected about me is gardening. For me it just
                feels like it, I adore nature, and I also do hope that nature adores me. Taking care 
                of it feels just "IT", I don't know how to explain it, but I just love to see it grow
                while I take care of it.

            <img src="Images/Geology Picture.jfif" alt="Geology Picture" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                I already mentioned this in the About section, GEOLOGY! This interest is very random;
                it arose when I was in 11th grade. I fell in love with the activity of studying rocks 
                and minerals, venturing in caves and such.

            <img src="Images/SHS School Picture.jfif" alt="SHS School Picture" class="section-image" /> 
            <p>
                As a student, one of my goals is to finish school with flying colors, and to finish it 
                with flying colors, I would do good in all activities. Some may call me "smart", but 
                for me I still am not. My mind had already set the meaning of being smart when I studied
                at STEC. In that school, everything is advanced. At first, it was very fast for me, considering
                that when I was still studying at MNHS for my JHS it was too chill. And the SHS experience hit
                me with a culture shock, which made me the person who I am right now. 
            </p> <br>

            <img src="Images/College School Picture.jfif" alt="College School Picture" class="section-image" />
            <p>
                When I arrived in LLCC, it also hit me with another culture shock, which was the realization
                of how different college compared with SHS. The first day was rough for me, since I did not know 
                anyone in the class, and I'm glad that after a few weeks, I found new peers and am also comfortable in 
                the new environment.
